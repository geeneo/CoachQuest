# CoachQuest to-do

## Next up

- [ ] **Dark mode toggle.** The app already follows the operating system's
      light/dark setting. Add a Light / Dark / System switch in Profile,
      remembered per browser.
- [ ] **Email (SMTP).** Admin → Settings: host, port, username, password
      (encrypted, write-only like the other secrets), from address, TLS.
      Include a "Send test email" button. Password reset depends on this.
- [ ] **Users change their own password.** Profile: current password + new
      password (min 12). Signs out the user's other sessions.
- [ ] **Forgot password.** "Forgot password?" on the sign-in page emails a
      single-use reset link that expires in 30 minutes.
      - The page always says "if that email has an account, we've sent a link",
        so it doesn't reveal who has an account.
      - Rate limited in nginx.
      - Resetting signs out every session.
      - Needs SMTP.
- [ ] **Backfill older data.** First sync imports 180 days of Strava and 30
      days of Garmin. Add a "Import older data" option on Connections:
      - Pick a start date (e.g. 1 year, 2 years, everything).
      - Runs in the background with progress shown on the card.
      - Respects Strava's rate limits (200 requests / 15 min, 2,000 a day,
        shared with Home Assistant and the old hub), pausing and resuming
        instead of failing.
      - Garmin wellness goes back day by day, so long ranges are slow; cap it
        or run it overnight.
      - The fitness chart and CTL get more accurate with more history.
- [ ] **Fill Profile from Garmin and/or Strava.** A "Pull from…" button per
      field (FTP, lactate threshold HR, max HR, weight), with a choice of
      Garmin, Strava or manual. Optionally keep it in sync on every sync.
      - Garmin has the most: cycling FTP, lactate threshold HR, max HR and
        weight (`get_cycling_ftp`, `get_lactate_threshold`,
        `get_heart_rate_zones`, user profile).
      - Strava has FTP and weight only when the athlete set them there. It
        needs the `profile:read_all` scope, so Strava users reconnect once.
      - Show where each value came from and when, e.g. "FTP 265 W · Garmin ·
        3 days ago".
      - When FTP or LTHR changes, recalculate TSS (Save already does this).
- [ ] **Admin sets a user's password.** Admin → Users: "Set password", or
      "Send reset link" once SMTP works. Signs that user out everywhere. Logged.
