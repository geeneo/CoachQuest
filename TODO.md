# CoachQuest to-do

## Next up

- [ ] **Dark mode toggle.** The app already follows the operating system's
      light/dark setting. Add a Light / Dark / System switch in Profile,
      remembered per browser.
- [ ] **Email (SMTP).** Admin → Settings: host, port, username, password
      (encrypted, write-only like the other secrets), from address, TLS.
      Include a "Send test email" button. Password reset depends on this.
- [ ] **Users change their own password.** Profile: current password + new
      password (min 12). Signs out the user's other sessions.
- [ ] **Forgot password.** "Forgot password?" on the sign-in page emails a
      single-use reset link that expires in 30 minutes.
      - The page always says "if that email has an account, we've sent a link",
        so it doesn't reveal who has an account.
      - Rate limited in nginx.
      - Resetting signs out every session.
      - Needs SMTP.
- [ ] **Admin sets a user's password.** Admin → Users: "Set password", or
      "Send reset link" once SMTP works. Signs that user out everywhere. Logged.
